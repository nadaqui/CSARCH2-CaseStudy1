## 1. Introduction

With a budget of only P20,000, our group worked on building a general-purpose PC with light gaming capabilities. We prioritized building a system that could handle everyday tasks and while also being able to run games with decent settings. With our limited budget, we had to be resourceful in searching for PC components that were both affordable and functional.

In building a balanced PC, we prioritized compatibility to ensure the PC worked and functioned smoothly as a system. Instead of looking for high-end components, we had to resort to much cheaper alternatives, evaluating which parts would give us the best performance given our budget. Overall, building a ₱20,000 PC required careful decision-making and making compromises to maximize performance without exceeding our assigned budget. Despite these limitations, we were able to create a functional PC that meets the needs of general-purpose use and light gaming. This project not only challenged us to work within financial constraints but also taught us the importance of planning, component compatibility, and critical thinking when building a PC on a tight budget.

## 6. Conclusion & Learnings

Throughout the process of building a PC, we gained valuable insights about the pricing, availability, and compatibility of components. One major realization was the significant difference in pricing between parts sourced internationally and those bought locally. However, the main challenge our group faced was working with a budget of only P20,000. While other groups had budgets of over 100k, we had very limited flexibility in choosing parts and had to make the most of what was available locally and within our price range. Many components were too expensive for us, which pushed us to look for cheaper alternatives. It was up to us to identify parts that were still functional despite the low cost. This required careful research and constant communication within the group.

Another important takeaway was the need to carefully check for compatibility between parts. It’s easy to get carried away with choosing parts without making sure they actually work together. We learned that building a PC isn’t just about picking high-quality components; it’s about making sure everything works well as a system to deliver good performance.
Overall, the project taught us that every PC build is unique and should be based on the specific needs of the user. There’s no one fixed solution, and finding the right balance between performance, budget, and compatibility is a process that takes time and experience to execute successfully.
